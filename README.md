# no-phi-ai
A golang-based GitHub App that uses Microsoft AI Language service to detect PHI/PII in GitHub comments, issues, and pull requests.
Not only can this GitHub App detect, it prevents protected data from being committed to shared source control.

Development of this GitHub App was inspired by the [GitHub Action from rob-derosa/pii-detection](https://github.com/rob-derosa/pii-detection).
